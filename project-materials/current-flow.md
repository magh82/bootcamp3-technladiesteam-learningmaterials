- Coach teams rank applicants according to their own sense of suitability for the bootcamp
- Elisha reviews ranking lists for each coaching team
- Elisha looks at number of participant slots to fill on each team, and starts filling them with applicants, in order of ranking provided by coaching team
- Elisha looks to see if there are any applicants slotted to more than one team, and marks them
- Elisha sends bootcamp acceptance email to unmarked applicants who have been slotted to a team
- Elisha sends decision email to marked applicants (who are still slotted to a team), asking these applicants to choose between the teams they have been slotted for
- Marked applicants choose a team from the ones they have been slotted for and reply to Elisha with their decision
- Elisha sends bootcamp acceptance email to marked applicants, and keeps the marked applicants in the slotted for the teams they selected, removing them from the other teams (which they decided not to join)
- Elisha looks at the number of remaining participant slots to fill on each team, and starts filling them with applicants from the ranking list again, repeating the subsequent steps until all team slots are filled
