## Week 1

1. What were some of the tasks that you do not feel comfortable executing by yourself?

	1. Git version control: Many times I had to duplicate the whole file manually, and deleting the entire folder when I messed up (esp for database conversion of sqlite to pg for heroku)

	2. Device Authentication: Met with alot of problems with this process, not sure when to create new controller, and when to create new model. Got stuck in the log out page loop. Could not render views for sign in and sign out page at first. 

	3. Writing own code: Most of the time I was just copying and pasting code from various sources and thus formatting for my application task was not standardised; Same thing written in different ways.


 2. Compare your app to one that you commonly use on the web. Rate your app on a scale of 1/10. Justify your rating. What are some of the concepts/skills that you need to learn/improve on?


    -  Compared with Twitter, I rate my app 3/10
    -  Skills to learn/improve on:
		- HTML CSS BOOTSTRAP:
			- Display my landing page in a non-scrollable page like the twitter homepage
			- Improve responsiveness of my site/app (When on a bigger screen my image did not fill the entire width)
		- FEATURES:
			- Implement search bar for keywords for blogposts
			- Ability to follow different users and repost micro-posts. (Blog could have a comment section for every post)
			- Ability to post well- formatted images together with the post
			- Live tweet updating real-time
